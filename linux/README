The files on this folder should be placed (with execute permissions) on your *nix with upstart capabilities to have osrm running as a daemon. You have to be root to do it.

Check the usr/bin/osrm file before proceed, as it will assume you have your code on /opt/Project-OSRM.

To give execute permission to this files, you can do:
# chmod +x $file
