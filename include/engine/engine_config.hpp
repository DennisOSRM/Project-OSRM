/**
 * Configures an OSRM instance.
 *
 * You can customize the storage OSRM uses for auxiliary files specifying a storage config.
 *
 * You can further set service constraints.
 * These are the maximum number of allowed locations (-1 for unlimited) for the services:
 *  - Trip
 *  - Route
 *  - Table
 *  - Match
 *  - Nearest
 *
 * You can restrict the coordinate search radius when a bearing is supplied.  This helps
 * prevent the rtree search expanding if a very narrow bearing filter is supplied.
 *
 * In addition, shared memory can be used for datasets loaded with osrm-datastore.
